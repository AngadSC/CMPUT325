1. Write it out into lambda form full form 

((( (lambda (x)
      (lambda (y)
        (lambda (z)
          (x (y (y z))))))

    (lambda (x) x))

   (lambda (x) (x (q q))))

  a)

Now that i have it written out we can strart with NOR 

Each is broken down above so the first statment 
I can break the (((A B) C) D), going down with the first being A ... etc 
With this the outermost is A B 
so we subsitute B into wherever we have occurenes of x 
then we get 

      (lambda (y)
        (lambda (z)
          ((lambda (x) x) (y (y z)))))
        Then we apply NOR again so replace occurnce of y with C which is 
        (lambda (x) (x (q q)))


(lambda (z)
          ((lambda (x) x) ((lambda (x) (x (q q))) ((lambda (x) (x (q q))) z))))

now we do the apply NOR again so replace z with a basically 

((lambda (x) x) ((lambda (x) (x (q q))) ((lambda (x) (x (q q))) a)))
So our outer lambda rn is ((lambda (x) x) argument) 
and since we replace the occurcnes of the param in the body with the arugment we are just left with the arugment 

((lambda (x) (x (q q)))
 ((lambda (x) (x (q q))) a))
 giving us that, now we replace the outer lambda param with its arugment 

 (((lambda (x) (x (q q))) a) (q q))
 now again we have argument of a with this part ((lambda (x) (x (q q))) a)
 replace the x with a and we get
 ((a (q q)) (q q)) and we are done with NOR reduction 
 Now with AOR 

 So we do innermost first 
 the only part of our expresion that has a redex is (A B) from above so both NOR and AOR reduce that first 
 
 and will give us 
 (lambda (y)
        (lambda (z)
          ((lambda (x) x) (y (y z)))))

and even from here we have to do the same reduction as we did with NOR

(lambda (z)
          ((lambda (x) x) ((lambda (x) (x (q q))) ((lambda (x) (x (q q))) z))))

and then the same thig we can't apply the reudction in any way thats diffent than NOR

((lambda (x) x) ((lambda (x) (x (q q))) ((lambda (x) (x (q q))) a)))
So the inntermost is 
((lambda (x) (x (q q))) a)

so we replace the params with the arugment 
so (a (q q))
so now we get 
((lambda (x) x) ((lambda (x) (x (q q))) )(a (q q)))
now we go to the next innermost lambda 
((lambda (x) (x (q q))) )(a (q q))

again we put in the arg as param
 ((a (q q)) (q q))
 and that gives us 
 ((lambda (x) x)
 ((a (q q)) (q q)))
 and with the lambda (x) x we jsut return the argument giving us 
 ((a (q q)) (q q))
 So the same as NOR 






 Question 2 
 Part A

 CT0
 ((f 3) 2) - our arugnemtns are just 3 and 2 
  where our F is  F = (lambda (x) (lambda (y) (* (+ 5 x) y)))
  [ (lambda (x) (lambda (y) (* (+ 5 x) y))) , CT0 ]
  And wwe have to elaute against the numbers so styarting with 3 
  [F, CT0] to 3 we apply the closure 
  so CT1 = {x = 3 } U CT0
  so thats the first context we assign x to the value 3 
  now we evalute the body to this 

[ (lambda (y) (* (+ 5 x) y)) , CT1 ]

[f, Ct1] 2
and we apply the closure to the second number 
Ct2 = { y =2 } U CT1 
giving us our second assingned vlaue 

and now we evaluate the body using all ourt assinged values
(*(+ 5 x) y) again x= 3 and y =2 
(* ( + 5 3 ) 2 ) = 16 



Part B 

First we apply (lambda (x z) ( x z)) to its 2 args being (lambda (x) (* x 2)) and 8 
sdo Ct1 = { x =  (lambda (x) (* x 2)), z =8} U CT0
 now we need to do that inner call 
 x points to another closure since its another lambda 
 so Ct2 = {x = 8} U Ct0 
 and now with tis we evalute the body with the assinged values 
 ( * x 2 ) = ( * 8 2 ) = 16
